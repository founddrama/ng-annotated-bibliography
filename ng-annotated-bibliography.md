# AngularJS: an annotated bibliography

### Angular JS Google Group: "service to manage the configuration of the app"
[[46][46]] \#service \#remote-configuration

The nutshell version of the question: **If my server-side app provides constants
and/or other data to configure aspects of my Angular application, how can I
bring those in at runtime?** Though it isn't explicitly said, the original
question ("Can I use `$http` during `factory` or in `$provider.get` to get these
data?") turns out to be more/less impossible; instantiation of the service has
no mechanism for being deferred. Instead, one user recommends: 

> You would prefer a json file when it is data that is shared between different
> sides like validation rules for server and client or data that is generated at
> build time. Then I would try to integrate the json file in the build process
> so I get a constant definition in angular.

Example:

```
angular.module('config').constant('generic', <%= json %>);
```

That one of Angular's service creator functions does _not_ take a promise (i.e.,
as opposed to "only" a function) seems like a missed opportunity, although there
are also some significant challenges there as well (e.g., what if the promise is
rejected?)

Arguments cane be made that this will work for small projects but maybe not for
large ones. Good source material though.

### Ben-Yosef: "Writing More Maintainable Angular.js Directives" (2014)
[[60][60]] \#directive \#require

Two "best practice" style tips to help orient AngularJS beginners on how to best
set up scaleable directives: use isolate scopes wherever possible, and make
liberal use of the `require` property in the directive's definition. (As an
aside: it's a fairly straightforward illustration of using `require`.)

### Briggs: "Code Organization in Angular" (2014)
[[61][61]] \#code-organization

Matt Briggs writing at the Nuology Engineering Blog on how to organize a "large"
AngularJS project. He covers the naïve method (e.g., all-in-one), following the
[angular-seed][16] recommendation, or else splitting by module. Splitting by
module is his clear recommendation, and he also suggests using it in combination
with RequireJS. Separating code per module makes sense, but there's still the
possibility of winding up with large bloated module files; one "class" per file
(organized in per-module directories) seems like the natural next step for the
truly large AngularJS application, although there are some potential maintenance
headaches with managing that many files. (Ask the question though: is it more of
a headache to manage the individual files if you have a good build system? or
more of a headache to sift through a thousands-of-lines file?)

### Burleson: "Dependency Injection using RequireJS & AngularJS" (2013)
[[48][48]] \#dependency-injection

An overview of dependency injection, a comparison of what that means in
RequireJS vs. what it means in AngularJS, and how to use RequireJS underneath
AngularJS to handle AMD. It's worth noting that an AMD style loader seems like
something that will eventually ship as part of AngularJS.

Consider it background reading for [Burleson's post on decorators][45].

### Burleson: "Enhancing AngularJS Logging using Decorators" (2013)
[[45][45]] \#service \#decorator \#aop

Though he doesn't cite something like [Gechev's methods](http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/08/07/aspect-oriented-programming-with-javascript-angularjs/),
Thomas describes using `$provide.decorator()` as the built-into-Angular solution
for AOP. It's a thorough example of how using the `decorator` function to modify
services in Angular. That being said, I have mixed feelings about the slightly
more complicated (`$log.getInstance`?) version of `$log` that he ends up with.
(As an aside: his use of RequireJS makes this not a "pure Angular" post and
diminishes some of the value; although I can see _why_ he went this route, I
think it adds some unnecessary overhead w/r/t/ illustrating the specific points
about `decorator`.)

### Conery: "Models and Services in Angular" (2013)
[[21][21]] \#model \#service

Rob Conery:

> ...if it's not presentation-related, it doesn't belong here.

He makes the point that services in Angular are not models, though they should
provide the API that your controllers etc. use to deal with the model data. He
also points out that you may be tempted to overload your models with a bunch of
behaviors. And in a nutshell he says: "Don't. That's what filters are for."

### Dobry: "Building large apps with AngularJS" (2013)
[[1][1], [2][2], [17][17]] \#architecture \#single-page-apps

Outstanding post by Jason Dobry about using AngularJS to do non-trivial UIs and
about some of the latent challenges that you'll encounter when doing so. He's
got quite a few interesting things to say, in particular about the common
misperception that `$scope` is the model, some points about how to organize your
files, and about integrating Angular with other libraries. It's one of the best
posts I've encountered on Angular so far, and he does an excellent job
explaining some of the more ambiguous things.

Also: the accompanying slide deck is pretty good, too.

### Dudulski: "Server form validation with Angular.js" (2013)
[[35][35]]

Jan Dudulski, writing at the Codetunes blog. By and large, I think if you're
dealing with `$`-prefixed properties directly, it's probably an AngularJS code
smell, but this technique looks pretty smart, and I think we can trust `$dirty`
and `$invalid` to be pretty stable features.

### Fletcher: "Decoupling from the DOM with Angular" (2013)
[[44][44]] \#controller \#directive \#separation-of-concerns

Rob Fletcher:

> Managing that kind of separation of concerns is the promise of Angular in a
> nutshell.

A good case study in best practices with controllers and directives and how to
think about separation of concerns in AngularJS. This is a particularly
interesting post because there's a strong temptation when developing directives
to "put it all in there" -- that once you've gotten to the point of creating the
directive, you're not really thinking about controllers anymore. But Fletcher
puts it well:

> Remember controllers are for managing view _state_ and directives are for
> managing the view _implementation_. If you find yourself mixing those concerns
> step back and think about how you can separate them.

### Fox: "Server-side HTML vs. JS Widgets vs. Single-Page Web Apps" (2013)
[[42][42]] \#architecture \#single-page-apps

Pamela Fox gives an overview of some of the server- vs. client-side UI decisions
(putting it in context at Coursera). She gets in to some of the trade-offs and
makes cases for each one having its place.

Not specific to AngularJS, but germane w/r/t/ architecture decisions.

### Gechev: "Aspect-Oriented Programming with AngularJS" (2013)
[[34][34]] \#aop

Minko Gechev presents a technique for AOP in AngularJS.

### Gharat: "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Directive" (2013)
[[54][54]] \#directive

Amit Gharat's breadth-first coverage of directives in AngularJS. What's
interesting about this introduction is rather than take a deep dive on any one
particular aspect of directives (like most other introductions), he tries to
cover at least a little something for everything under the umbrella. He also
structured it such that later examples help to inform earlier examples.

### Hacker News: "We used to write things like..." (2013)
[[10][10]] \#template-as-dsl \#templates \#criticism \#progressive-enhancement

**tl;dr:** It looks like `onclick` all over again, and/but ng templates are
really just a DSL for producing single-page apps? And/but: progressive
enhancement is the elephant in the room here.

I promise I won't make a habit of linking to Hacker News, but this was timely
because this was something that I found myself thinking about while hacking
together the [Project Management Dev Dice](http://dev-dice.herokuapp.com/).
"What makes `ng-click` any different from `onclick`?" There's the usual HN
signal/noise to deal with here, but most of the discussion is worthwhile. For my
money, where I landed on this was as follows: what makes `ng-click` and its
brethren different than the old-fashioned tight-coupling of `onclick` etc. is
that the the Angular views are basically hybridizing mark-up and JavaScript
anyway — (a DSL?) — the lines are blurry. (And isn't Angular's philosophy to be
declarative? to add something to the mark-up that it "should" have?) Now if I
can just reconcile the whole "not progressively enhanced" bit that goes
hand-in-hand with Angular...

### Hartikainen: "Knockout vs Backbone vs Angular" (2013)
[[13][13]] \#comparison

Jani Hartikainen (CodeUtopia) doing a side-by-side-by-side comparison of these
three popular libraries. In his opinion, none of the three is a clear winner
over the others, but he does a good job of illustrating the pros and cons of
each.

### Hess: "AngularJS Directive Design Made Easy" (2013)
[[49][49]] \#directive

Sean Hess to answer the question:

> How do I talk to a directive?

Overall a good introduction, but two cautions:

1. He introduces `attrs.$observe()` without explaining why you would use them
   _instead_ of `@` style literal-bindings with the directive's `scope`.
2. I disagree with the assertion that you should focus on state (i.e., "It’s
   totally fine to have a `windowShown` boolean on your controller..."); in my
   experience, you should be conservative w/r/t/ the state you are explicitly
   tracking.

### Hooks: "Configuring Dependency Injection in AngularJS" (2013)
[[30][30]] \#dependency-injection \#service

Overview of services. Defining via `module.service` vs. `module.factory` vs.
`module.provider`. (Mentions but does not cover `value` and `constant`
dependencies.)

- `service` calls `factory`
  -  and/but uses `new` on constructor fn via `$injector.instantiate`
- `factory` calls `provider`
  - _but_ no `new`, and expects your "constructor" to return an object
- `provider` makes internal use of `$get`
  - maximum flexibility for maximum complexity

```
function provider(name, provider_) {
    if (isFunction(provider_) || isArray(provider_)) {
      provider_ = providerInjector.instantiate(provider_);
    }
    if (!provider_.$get) {
      throw $injectorMinErr('pget', "Provider '{0}' must define $get factory method.", name);
    }
    return providerCache[name + providerSuffix] = provider_;
  }

  function factory(name, factoryFn) { return provider(name, { $get: factoryFn }); }

  function service(name, constructor) {
    return factory(name, ['$injector', function($injector) {
      return $injector.instantiate(constructor);

[[58][58]] \#testing

Nathan LeClair's introduction to testing in AngularJS. He focuses on unit

### Lerner: "Build custom directives with AngularJS" (2013)
[[4][4]] \#directive

Ari Lerner. Long-ish expository post in the ng-newsletter about creating and
working with Angular directives. Directives are a really powerful part of
Angular but can be a bit daunting to newcomers ("Scopes? Restrictions? Linking
functions!?") but do yourself a favor: have the patience to learn the
fundamentals of directives. That will pay dividends.

### Lerner: "The Definitive Guide to Angular on Mobile" (2013)
[[50][50]] \#mobile \#cordova

(Ran as part of the ng-newsletter; only presumably written by Ari Lerner.) Maybe
less "the definitive guide" and more of a "solid introduction"; the highlight
reel includes:

- overview of `angular-touch` and `angular-gestures` re: doing touch interfaces
  in AngularJS
- overview of integrating [Cordova][51] into your AngularJS development workflow
  w/r/t/ building "compiled-to-native" apps

Craig McKeachie doing some side-by-side, feature-for-feature comparisons of a
couple JavaScript MV* frameworks. His emphasis is mostly on AngularJS,
Backbone.js, Ember, and Knockout, but a couple of other libraries make cameos
as well. The title is a little misleading because he's talking less about the
size of each framework and more about how "rich" each one is. He lays out some
good points w/r/t/ things you should consider when choosing such a framework
(and/or whether you should choose one at all).

[[7][7], [8][8]] \#web-components

David Mosher, writing about Polymer and Angular, and Web Components in a more
general way. In a nutshell he argues (as Yehuda Katz does) that
library/framework designers serve the community better by focusing on the
low-level APIs and letting the best ideas percolate up until they become part of
the standards. I agree with this point — you can look at how this has worked out
with Backbone (as he mentions) or go further back to jQuery and it becomes clear
how these feedback loops are tremendous success stories. On the other hand: I
wish people would stop dumping on Ember.js. There's a place for higher-level
frameworks like it, too.

[[52][52]] \#logging \#error-handling

Ben Nadel illustrates a custom `$exceptionHandler` provider using Stacktrace.js
to catch client side errors and stacktraces and send them back to the server. He
mentions in his conclusion that he was surprised at how many errors were thrown
in production; he doesn't speak to the server-side infrastructure for logging
the errors, but it's a worthwhile read nonetheless.

Side note: the first thing I thought when I saw that he was overriding
`$exceptionHandler` was: _Why not use a decorator?_ (And sure enough, there is a
discussion of it in the comments.)

### Nelson: "Minimizing initialization time in AngularJS" (2013)
[[59][59]] \#preload \#caching

Zak Nelson writes about using embedded `text/ng-template` script types as an
alternative to remote templates as a way of improving initial load times in
AngularJS applications. He also has a few other tips, specifically around using
`$cacheFactory` for caching and "pre-loading" certain types of API requests.
And if you can automate a lot of these, they look like good ways to get some
performance wins. (Using a fairly narrow definition of performance here...)

A write-up by Jaco Pretorius. I agree with him on the documentation, and I
(admittedly, sadly) don't have enough experience with the testing aspect to have
an opinion there, but I'd be willing to split hairs on the "overall complexity"
complaint.

Given my experience so far, I would say that the trivial things are quite
trivial, and though the non-trivial things take a bit of work, none of them have
blocked me for more than an hour or two. There's a bit of push/pull, but I've
also only been doing non-trivial stuff with it for a short time, and I feel like
each time I get stumped, I come out the other side with a much better
understanding of the framework. It's opinionated, and there's "an Angular way"
of doing things — but it's not always clear (at first) what that way is. And I
blame the documentation for that.

Dr. Axel Rauschmayer on Google's Polymer:

> interfaces efficiently and frameworks help.

I largely agree with his points, especially the thrust of the above pull-quote.
When discussing frameworks and libraries like this, it's easy to lose sight of
the fact that they're around because of some gaping hole in the language's
native/standard libraries. Google's recent efforts (e.g., AngularJS and now
Polymer) point to more declarative or component-oriented approaches; put in the
context of HTML5 and the advancements there, that makes a lot of sense. I'm
interested in Polymer, but I feel like I need some more time to digest it. Like
when Twitter open-sourced Flight, there's this sense of: "Cool! That's a novel
approach..." Which also feels a bit like: "Whoa, that's really different." Now
to dig in...

Jesus Rodriguez with a deep dive into the `$digest` cycle and how to master
`$watch` and `$apply`.

### Rodriguez: "Tip: Directives With the Same Name" (2013)
[[43][43]] \#directive

Jesus Rodriguez points out that AngularJS basically overloads directives,
effectively stacking them as an array of callables. This can make it easy to
"magically" add functionality (e.g., logging on top of the usual `ng-click`
behavior, as in his example), and though it may be "very intentional" in their
code, this kind of overloading seems potentially dangerous. Use with caution;
consider AOP instead?

### Rodriguez: "Understanding Service Types" (2013)
[[47][47]] \#service

Along the same lines as the overview of service types that [Hooks][30] gave; but
where Hooks went deeper on `factory` vs. `service` vs. `provider`, Rodriguez
goes broader and includes `constant` and `value` and `decorator`.

### Savkin: "Contrasting Backbone vs. Angular" (2013)
[[57][57]] \#comparison \#backbone

Victor Savkin does a reasonably good job of contrasting Backbone.js and
AngularJS, trying to provide a balanced pros-and-cons comparison. He does a
better job of explaining Angular, and is borderline harsh about some of
Backbone's fundamental design choices. That being said, I appreciate that he
acknowledges that they're not apples-to-apples comparisons, and that Backbone is
intentionally much more spartan.

If you've narrowed your MVC search to Backbone and Angular, this is a good piece
to read (though I'd say to find one more with a slightly more favorable
treatment of Backbone).

### Scalyr Blog: "Optimizing AngularJS: 1200ms to 35ms" (2013)
[[55][55]] \#performance

An interesting performance-centric blog post on the Scalyr Blog that talks about
pushing AngularJS to its limits and demonstrating a &asymp;34&times; speed-up.
It does not come without cautions, however -- the Scalyr team "broke some rules"
and tapped into some of the framework's underlying abstractions (e.g.,
"private" properties and methods) and, as some pointed out in the comments, an
alternative solution that made better use of event delegation _might_ have been
even more performant and less complex. Despite these criticisms, the blog post
represents an interesting case study, and illustrates several interesting
observations about performance tuning with respect to:

1. re-using DOM elements;
2. deferred renderings; and
3. optimizing `$watch` functions.
